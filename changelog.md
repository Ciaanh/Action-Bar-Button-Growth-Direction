### 1.0.3 (2023-05-27)
- Improved icon
- Changed readme text so that it will render more or less correctly with CurseForgeâ€™s broken MD renderer, as well as with non broken MD renderers, e.g. GitHub, or everything else that is not CurseForge. They (Overwolf) really should get the formatting on their pages fixed. Getting tired of this.

### 1.0.2 (2023-05-24)
- Added icon for the addon list

### 1.0.1 (2023-05-24)
- Fixed CF ID in toc

### 1.0 (2023-05-24)
