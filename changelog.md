#### 1.0.4 (2023-07-12)

- toc updated for 10.1.5.
  - I have not yet had a chance to really test the addon with 10.1.5. There is a small chance that some of the API changes may affect the addon. If I find any problems, you'll get a content update soon.

#### 1.0.3 (2023-05-27)

- Improved icon.
- Changed readme text so that it will render more or less correctly with CurseForgeâ€™s broken MD renderer, as well as with non broken MD renderers, e.g. GitHub, or everything else that is not CurseForge. They (Overwolf) really should get the formatting on their pages fixed. Getting tired of this.

- Added icon for the addon list.

#### 1.0.1 (2023-05-24)
