## Releases

#### 1.0.12 (2024-10-23)

- toc bump, docs.
- No content changes.

#### 1.0.11 (2024-07-24)

- Seems to work fine with TWW 110000; further tests will follow.
- On first launch with 110000, I had to re-enable my action bars in the client settings. Probably this is not related to the addon, not sure though.
- toc updated for TWW 110000.

#### 1.0.10 (2024-05-08)

- toc bump only (100207). Addon update will follow as needed.

#### 1.0.9 (2024-03-19)

- toc bump only. If necessary, the addon will be updated in the next days.

#### 1.0.8 (2024-01-16)

- Just a toc bump for 10.2.5. Compatibility update will follow if needed.

#### 1.0.7 (2023-11-08)

-toc update 100200; no content changes.

#### 1.0.6 (2023-09-06)

- toc bump 100107.
- Minor changes to the Readme.

#### 1.0.5 (2023-07-12)

- Readme improved.

#### 1.0.4 (2023-07-12)

- toc updated for 10.1.5.
  - I have not yet had a chance to really test the addon with 10.1.5. There is a small chance that some of the API changes may affect the addon. If I find any problems, you'll get a content update soon.

#### 1.0.3 (2023-05-27)

- Improved icon.
- Changed readme text so that it will render more or less correctly with CurseForgeâ€™s broken MD renderer, as well as with non broken MD renderers, e.g. GitHub, or everything else that is not CurseForge. They (Overwolf) really should get the formatting on their pages fixed. Getting tired of this.

#### 1.0.2 (2023-05-24)

- Added icon for the addon list.

#### 1.0.1 (2023-05-24)

- Fixed CF ID in toc.

#### 1.0 (2023-05-24)

- Initial CurseForge upload.
